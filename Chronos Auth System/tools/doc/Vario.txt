== Vario Module ==

- Pressing the "v" (down) button cycles between displays as follows:
        
    * vario (in m/s)
	  Displays a signed fractional value representing the ascent or
          descent speed in meters per second.

    * vario (in Pascal)
          Displays a signed integer value representing the ascent or
          descent speed in Pascal/second.

    * pressure (in hPa)
          Displays a signed fraction representing the pressure measured at
          the current altitude.

    * max Vz (in m/s)
          Displays the maximum vertical speed in meters/second.

    * min Vz (in m/s)
          Displays the minimum vertical speed in meters/second.
    
- A long press on the "#" button performs a context sensitive function:
    
    * during vario display, changes the vario sound mode:
      Off      (default, no symbol displayed)
      Ascent 0 (start beeping at 0.0m/s, beeper1 and beeper2 symbols
               displayed)
      Ascent 1 (start beeping at 0.1m/s, beeper1 symbol displayed)
      Both     (beep for up or down, beeper1 and beeper2 symbols
               displayed)

      Tone frequency, number and duration of beeps depend on climb rate.

    * during max/min Vz display, resets both the max and min values.
    
- The "record" icon is flashed at one second intervals, indicating that
  the watch is in vario mode and receiving pressure measurements.
          
  Note that the upper line must be in altimeter mode for the vario to
  work, as it relies on updates from the altimeter. If the altimeter
  is not active, the vario display shows "noAlt".
